Material Witness Compat
=======================

A Google I/O 2014 demo written by [Romain Guy][1] ported to work on all versions of the platform back to Android 2.3.3 (API Level 10). 

The original Material Witness is a sample application for the new Material Design APIs introduced in the Android L Preview SDK. Most of the features have been backported and include:

* Dynamic palette using the palette support library
* Circular reveal using the blog post by [Romain Guy][1] using [bitmap shaders][4]
* Activity transitions using the DevByte from [Chet Haase][10] on [custom activity animations][3]
* Path tracing using the blog post by [Romain Guy][1] using [path effects][5] 

Features that couldn't be backported include:

* Custom theme colors. Whatever is allowed by the the v7 appcompat library has been implemented
* Ripple drawables

The complete video of the Google I/O 2014 talk detailing how the original application works can be found on [YouTube][2].
